### BlockWorld State Tracking and Move Validation Prompt  

You are tasked with analyzing BlockWorld problems where blocks must be moved between columns to achieve a target configuration. Follow these precise guidelines:

#### State Management  
- Track initial positions of all blocks by column number.  
- Update the state after each prerequisite move to maintain accuracy.  
- Use the updated state as the starting point for evaluating solution options.  

#### Move Validation  
For each move in a proposed solution:  

✅ **Location Check:** Ensure the block is actually in the stated source column. Reject moves referencing incorrect locations.  
✅ **Accessibility Check:** Verify the block has no other blocks stacked on top of it.  
✅ **Destination Check:** Ensure the destination column can legally receive the block.  

#### Solution Evaluation Procedure  
1. Process prerequisite moves first and document the intermediate state.  
2. Evaluate each solution option starting from the intermediate state, updating after each move.  
3. Reject any option with an invalid move (e.g., moving a block from a column it isn’t in).  

#### Decision Rules  
🚫 **Eliminate any option with even one invalid move.**  
✅ **Select valid options that achieve the target state.**  
➕ **Extra moves are allowed if all moves are valid.**  


 


[BlockWorld Puzzle Description]

        This puzzle involves moving blocks between columns to transform an initial configuration into a target configuration. Each block is uniquely identified by its ID number and color.

[Initial Configuration]
Column 0 is empty.
Column 1 has a single green block (ID: 2).
Column 2 has a single red block (ID: 5).
Column 3 has 3 blocks stacked from bottom to top: - bottom: blue block (ID: 0) - position 2: purple block (ID: 3) - top: pink block (ID: 4)
Column 4 has a single yellow block (ID: 1).

[Previously Executed Moves]
The following moves were correctly executed:
1. Move block 2 from column 1 to column 0
2. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 3



[Target Configuration]
The final configuration that needs to be achieved is:
Column 0 is empty.
Column 1 has 2 blocks stacked from bottom to top: - bottom: green block (ID: 2) - top: pink block (ID: 4)
Column 2 has a single red block (ID: 5).
Column 3 has 2 blocks stacked from bottom to top: - bottom: blue block (ID: 0) - top: purple block (ID: 3)
Column 4 has a single yellow block (ID: 1).

[Rules]
- Blocks can only be moved if there are no blocks above them
- Blocks must be placed either on an empty column or on top of another block
- The final configuration must exactly match the target state

[Options]
Choose from these sequences to fix the mistake and complete the transformation:

Option A:
1. Move block 2 from column 1 to column 0
2. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 3
3. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 1
4. Move block 4 from column 3 to column 1

Option B:
1. Move block 2 from column 1 to column 0
2. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 3
3. Move block 2 from column 3 to column 2

Option C:
1. Move block 2 from column 3 to column 0
2. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 1
3. Move block 4 from column 3 to column 1

Option D:
1. Move block 2 from column 1 to column 0
2. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 3
3. Move block 1 from column 4 to column 2
4. Move block 2 from column 0 to column 1
5. Move block 4 from column 3 to column 1

[Question]
