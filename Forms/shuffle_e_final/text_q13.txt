Analyze image patch rearrangement problems by validating move sequences to transform a shuffled image into a target image. The problem includes:
- Initial shuffled image state
- Target image state
- Set of already performed moves
- Options for completing the rearrangement

## Initial State Management
1. Grid State Recording:
   - Document the initial position of each patch using (row,col) coordinates
   - CRITICAL: Apply all given moves to create an intermediate state
   - Use the intermediate state as the TRUE starting point for evaluation

2. Patch Position Tracking:
   - Create a position map showing the current location of each patch
   - Update this map after EACH move in the given sequence
   - Track which patches have been moved and their new positions

## Move Validation Protocol
For each proposed sequence:
1. Starting State Validation
   - CRITICAL: Start from the intermediate state after applying given moves
   - Track the current position of each patch based on previous moves
   - Reject moves that reference incorrect patch positions

2. Move Legality Check
   - Verify each patch being moved exists in the stated location
   - Confirm swaps are between valid grid positions
   - Ensure no out-of-bounds moves

3. State Update Requirements
   - Update patch positions after each move
   - Use updated positions for validating subsequent moves
   - Maintain consistency in patch tracking

## Solution Evaluation Procedure
1. Process Given Moves First
   - Execute all provided moves in sequence
   - Document resulting intermediate state explicitly
   - Use this as the starting point for evaluating options

2. Option Analysis
   For each solution option:
   - Start from the documented intermediate state
   - Validate each move against current patch positions
   - Update state after each valid move
   - Track progress toward target configuration



## Final State Verification
1. Compare achieved state with the target:
   - Position of each patch
   - Overall configuration
   - Completeness of transformation

## Decision Making Rules
1. Eliminate any option that:
   - Contains even one invalid move
   - References incorrect patch locations
   - Has impossible transitions
   - Starts from the wrong intermediate state

2. From remaining valid options:
   - Select options that achieve the target configuration
   - Extra moves are acceptable if all moves are valid
   - No credit for options with invalid moves

## Response Format
Provide only the letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponding to the valid solution that:
1. Starts from the correct intermediate state
2. Contains only valid moves
3. Achieves the target configuration

 Following steps have already been taken to rearrange the shuffled image Step 1: Swap patch at (0, 0) with patch at (2, 2)
Step 2: Swap patch at (0, 1) with patch at (0, 0)
Step 3: Swap patch at (0, 2) with patch at (0, 1)
Step 4: Swap patch at (1, 0) with patch at (0, 2)
Step 5: Swap patch at (1, 1) with patch at (2, 2).select the correct option that correctly rearranges the patches to form the target image from the provided shuffled image. Each patch is referred to by its row and column, such that (0,0) refers to the patch in row 0, column 0. The top-left patch is labelled as (0,0). Provide only the option as answer without any explanation
