Analyze image patch rearrangement problems by validating move sequences to transform a shuffled image into a target image. The problem includes:
- Initial shuffled image state
- Target image state
- Set of already performed moves

## Response Format
Provide only the letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponding to the valid solution that:
1. Starts from the correct intermediate state
2. Contains only valid moves
3. Achieves the target configuration

 Following steps have already been taken to rearrange the shuffled image Step 1: Swap patch at [0, 0] with patch at [1, 0]
Step 2: Swap patch at (0, 0) with patch at (2, 1).select the correct option that correctly rearranges the patches to form the target image from the provided shuffled image. Each patch is referred to by its row and column, such that (0,0) refers to the patch in row 0, column 0. The top-left patch is labelled as (0,0). Provide only the option as answer without any explanation

Options:

A.
Step 1: Swap patch at [0, 1] with patch at [1, 1]

B.
Step 1: Swap patch at (2, 1) with patch at (0, 0)
Step 2: Swap patch at [0, 1] with patch at [1, 1]

C.
Step 1: Swap patch at [0, 0] with patch at [1, 0]
Step 2: Swap patch at [0, 0] with patch at [1, 0]
Step 3: Swap patch at (0, 0) with patch at (1, 0)
Step 4: Swap patch at [0, 1] with patch at [1, 1]

D.
Step 1: Swap patch at [0, 0] with patch at [1, 0]
Step 2: Swap patch at (0, 0) with patch at (2, 1)
